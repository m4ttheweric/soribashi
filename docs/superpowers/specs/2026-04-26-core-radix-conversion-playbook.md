## How to read this playbook

The playbook is the synthesis layer over the pilot journals. The journals are the raw evidence — what was tried, what surfaced, what design choices were made and why. The playbook abstracts that into transferable methodology and recommended patterns.

The playbook is designed to extend, not be rewritten. Each future wave (Tooltip, Tabs, Select) appends its category-specific authoring pattern to § 2 and contributes additional gaps to § 3.

## 1. Token consolidation methodology

The methodology is a 6-step loop that takes a fragmented design system and outputs a single focused soribashi theme. Wave 1 ran it against CVI; the same loop applies to any other library.

### Step 1: Inventory

Enumerate every token. For CSS-var-driven systems: read every `--*` declaration in your styles + every reference in your Tailwind config. Capture: name, light value, dark value, where defined, where used (rough usage count).

**Output:** a table — one row per token. (See `docs/superpowers/pilots/2026-04-26-token-consolidation.md` § 1 for the Wave 1 example.)

**Why:** classification needs evidence. Without the full inventory you'll miss duplicates and shadows.

### Step 2: Classify

Tag each token as:
- **signal** — real design intent. Kept.
- **hack** — tooling artifacts (shadcn defaults, framework defaults that were never customized intentionally). Dropped.
- **duplication** — same value under multiple names. Collapsed to one canonical.
- **deferred** — chart colors, ad-hoc one-offs. Documented but out of scope for this consolidation pass.

**Output:** add a `Class` column to the inventory table. Surface open questions in a separate section. (See journal § 2 for distribution stats and § 4 for the deprecation list grouped by class.)

**Why:** without forcing classification, "everything is signal" creeps in and the consolidation loses value.

### Step 3: Express

Build the soribashi theme via `createTheme()`. Express:
- Brand/intent **scales** as `tokens.colors.{family}.{50..950}` — regenerate any scales that don't ramp coherently.
- **Semantic tokens** via `semantic.{text, surface, border}` references to scale anchors — never parallel hand-set values.
- **Dark variants** via the `dark` partial.

**Output:** `theme/index.ts` — the consolidated theme. (See journal § 3 for the Wave 1 decisions: families included, scale regenerations, duplicates collapsed, semantic surface choices.)

**Why:** soribashi's intent resolver gives you a clean home for "semantic name → scale lookup." Resist the urge to hand-set semantic colors.

### Step 4: Codegen

Run `soribashi codegen build --config <pilot>/soribashi.config.ts`. Produces `theme.css` (vars) + `tailwind.config.generated.js` (Tailwind partial).

Wire into the host's `tailwind.config.js` via the compose pattern (Option C — see § 3 for the C → A roadmap):

```js
const generated = require('./src/generated/tailwind.config.generated.js');
module.exports = {
  ...generated,
  content: [...],
  darkMode: 'class', // or your scope
  corePlugins: { preflight: false }, // mirror your host's setting
  plugins: [...(generated.plugins ?? []), require('tailwindcss-animate')],
};
```

**Output:** generated files committed; styles.css imports them; Tailwind utilities resolve from the consolidated theme.

### Step 5: Review

Build a `TokenReview` swatch page (every consolidated token rendered as a labeled swatch in light + dark) and a `ScreenReplica` (static markup of one representative screen using only consolidated tokens). Compare the replica against a screenshot of the original.

**Output:** visual review findings in the journal. (See journal § 7 for the Wave 1 intent-parity sign-off, expected drift, and unexpected drift findings.)

**Why:** **intent parity, not pixel parity.** Drift wherever consolidation deliberately changed something is expected and good. Drift you didn't expect is a finding.

### Step 6: Decide

For every open design question surfaced during steps 2-5: pick a defensible default, document the rationale, flag for human design review. The pilot doesn't block on design's blessing — the playbook escalates.

**Output:** the open-questions section of the journal, ready for design owner review. (See journal § 5 for the Wave 1 questions Q1-Q10.)

### What this methodology assumes

- The host's design system is at least partly token-driven (CSS vars, Tailwind config, etc.). Hand-set hex values everywhere makes consolidation harder; you'll need a preliminary "extract tokens from inline styles" pass first.
- You can run the host's codebase (or a recent screenshot of it) for visual review.
- A human design owner exists and can answer escalated questions.

If any of these don't hold, the methodology is still valuable but produces less confident output.
